              What is Air Pollution?
            </h2>
            <p class="about_text" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="450">
              Air pollution can be defined as the presence of toxic chemicals or compounds
                (including those of biological origin) in the air, at levels that pose a
                health risk. In an even broader sense, air pollution means the presence
                of chemicals or compounds in the air which are usually not present and
                which lower the quality of the air or cause detrimental changes to the
                quality of life (such as the damaging of the ozone layer or causing global warming).

              <br>
                <h3>Causes</h3>
              Air pollution is probably one of the most serious environmental problems confronting
              our civilization today. Most often, it is caused by human activities such as mining,
              onstruction, transportation, industrial work, agriculture, smelting, etc. However,
              natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and wildfires may also pollute the air,
              but their occurrence is rare and they usually have a local effect, unlike human activities
              that are ubiquitous causes of air pollution and contribute to the global pollution of the air every single day.

                <h3>Examples of Air Pollution </h3>
              In most cases, air pollutants cannot be seen or smelled. However, that does not mean that
              they do not exist in high enough amounts to be a health hazard! Additionally, a number
              of gases are linked to the so-called "greenhouse effect", which means that those gases
              retain more heat and thus contribute to the overall global warming. The most common example
              of a greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, which is emitted from many industrial processes.
              Another example is methane, which is also an explosive gas.

               <br><h3>The Effects of Air Pollution on Human Health </h3>
              Air pollution has serious effects on the human health. Depending on the level of exposure
              and the type of pollutant inhaled, these effects can vary, ranging from simple symptoms
              like coughing and the irritation of the respiratory tract to acute conditions like asthma
              and chronic lung diseases.
                Skin problems and irritations can develop due to prolonged exposure to several air pollutants,
              nd a variety of cancer forms may develop after inhaling air contaminants. Do not neglect potential
              diseases caused by air pollution.

                Air pollutants that have serious negative effects on the human health can be
              classified as toxic and non-toxic.

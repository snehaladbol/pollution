              What is Water Pollution?
            </h2>
            <p class="about_text" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="450">
             Water pollution is defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals
                and biological agents that exceed what is naturally found in the water and
                may pose a threat to human health and/or the environment. Additionally,
                water pollution may consist of chemicals introduced into the water bodies as
                a result of various human activities. Any amount of those chemicals pollutes
                the water, regardless of the harm they may pose to human health and the environment.

              <br>
                <h3>Causes</h3>
             Many of the chlorinated solvents commonly used in industry (such as PCE, TCE, 1,1,1-TCA) are
              examples of such chemicals polluting our waters exclusively due to human activities. Another
              example is MTBE (Methyl-tert-butyl-ether), a gasoline oxygenate that is currently banned in
              the U.S. Regardless of their provenance, the chemicals or biological agents causing water
              pollution are generically referred to as water pollutants.The chemical and biological agents
              represent the main causes of water pollution and are generically referred to as water pollutants.

              <br>
                Any kind of water can become polluted, regardless of its size or location.
              This includes lakes from remote areas or huge water bodies and is due to the air
              transportation of pollutant particles and their transfer into precipitation water.
              The groundwater and surface water consist of swimming pools, ponds, lakes, creeks,
              rivers, seas, and oceans that may all become polluted at some point. Due to the quick
              diffusion and dissipation of contamination and the faster natural degradation processes,
              the bigger the water body is, the shorter the time required for naturally cleansing the
              pollution and recovery.
              <br>

               <br><h3>The Effects of Water Pollution</h3>
             The effect of water pollution depends upon the type of pollutants and its concentration. Also,
              the location of water bodies is an important factor to determine the levels of pollution.
              <br>
              <br>


              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Water bodies in the vicinity of urban areas are extremely polluted. This is the result
                      of dumping garbage and toxic chemicals by industrial and commercial establishments.
                  </li>

                  <li>

                      Water pollution drastically affects aquatic life. It affects their metabolism,
                      behaviour, causes illness and eventual death. Dioxin is a chemical that causes a
                      lot of problems from reproduction to uncontrolled cell growth or cancer. This
                      chemical is bioaccumulated in fish, chicken and meat. Chemicals such as this
                      travel up the food chain before entering the human body.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        The effect of water pollution can have a huge impact on the food chain.
                      It disrupts the food-chain. Cadmium and lead are some toxic substances,
                      these pollutants upon entering the food chain through animals (fish when
                      consumed by animals, humans) can continue to disrupt at higher levels
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        Humans are affected by pollution and can contract diseases such as hepatitis through faecal matter in water sources.
                      Poor drinking water treatment and unfit water can always cause an outbreak of infectious diseases such as cholera, etc.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        The ecosystem can be critically affected, modified and destructured because of water pollution.
                  </li>
